# Reflection

## What went well
* Pull Requests, were meaningful and we all had a roughly equal amount.
* PR Reviews, had a ridgid procedure that everyone stuck to taking the time to analyze the code.
* Implementation, was done after the tests were all written and was ensured to be running.
* Overall Communication, we had consistent scrums that everyone participated in.

## What didn't go well
* Late Start to Implementation, we started implementing after we created all ISP tables pushing us to start later.
* GitHub Issue responsibility confusion, slight missunderstanding on what issues people were to complete.

## Overview
All things considered as a team we were able to sucessfuly complete this sprint working as a cohesive unit. Going forward we plan to act sooner on implementation and plan out our sprint better. We are also talking about a better way to assign tasks while completing dependencies first. Other than those things we will continue heading in our current direction.
