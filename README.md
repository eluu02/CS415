## Prerequisites

* JDK 8
* Maven
* NodeJS >= 18

## Department machines

You can code on the Linux departments machines by loading the course module.

Run `module load courses/cs415`.

This loads the correct version of Java, Maven, and NodeJS.

You should not be defining `JAVA_HOME` in your `~/.bashrc` or anywhere else.

Run `module list` 

This shows whether the cs415 course module is loaded successfully or not.
